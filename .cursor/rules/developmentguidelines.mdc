# Development Guidelines

## Project Documentation

- **Product Requirements**: Before implementing any feature, consult [IPLFantasyPRD.md](mdc:docs/IPLFantasyPRD.md) to ensure alignment with the original product vision.
- **Technical Architecture**: Reference [IPLFantasyTechSpec.md](mdc:docs/IPLFantasyTechSpec.md).md for the architectural blueprint. Any deviations must be discussed and documented.
- **Code Organization**: Follow @StoryApp_repostructure.md for file/folder conventions and component placement.

## Development Principles

1. **Simplicity First**: Prioritize readable, maintainable solutions over complex optimizations.
2. **Mobile-First**: All UI components must work flawlessly on mobile devices.
3. **Accessibility**: Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout development.

## Code Contribution Workflow

1. Reference the appropriate documentation before starting work
2. Create feature branches following the pattern: `feature/[feature-name]`
3. Implement changes adhering to the project's coding standards
4. Document any technical decisions that deviate from the spec with clear rationale
5. Submit PRs with comprehensive descriptions referencing relevant project documentation

## Tech Stack Consistency

- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS with ShadCN UI components
- Clerk for authentication
- Supabase for database
- Gemini API for AI generation

Maintain consistency with these choices unless there's a compelling reason to change. Document any alternative approaches.
